### Securities/Funds

Securities/Funds is a collective investment scheme where money from many investors is pooled together to purchase short-term, low-risk, and highly liquid debt instruments.

#### Transaction

The Transactions section is where all money movements are handled. Here you can make withdrawals, switch between your different accounts, and transfer funds from one account to another.

### Repports
The Reports section provides a summary of key information about clients and agents. It brings together important data in one place so that you can quickly review client activity, agent performance, and other high-level trends that support monitoring and decision-making.

### Statements

The Statements section gives you a detailed record of account activity over a selected period. It shows the amounts deposited, the funds invested, and the interest earned.



### Finance

Fund expenses are accrued daily and reduce the daily fund value. Typical expenses include management fee, trust fee, and custody fee.
